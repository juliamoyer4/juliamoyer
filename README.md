Utilized HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing, responsive,  and intuitive website describing the best places to study on UW-Madison campus with five interlinked pages. Applied CSS styling to present images and text in a visually appealing and readable layout. Prioritized accessibility by evaluating the website through Wave by Webaim ensuring that all images had alternate text and confirmed overall site accessibility.
